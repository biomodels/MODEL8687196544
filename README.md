# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A quantitative analysis of cardiac myocyte relaxation: a simulation study.**   
Niederer SA, Hunter PJ, Smith NP. _Biophys J._ 2006:90(5):1697-722.
[16339881](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16339881) ,  
**Abstract:**   
The determinants of relaxation in cardiac muscle are poorly understood, yet
compromised relaxation accompanies various pathologies and impaired pump
function. In this study, we develop a model of active contraction to elucidate
the relative importance of the [Ca2+]i transient magnitude, the unbinding of
Ca2+ from troponin C (TnC), and the length-dependence of tension and Ca2+
sensitivity on relaxation. Using the framework proposed by one of our
researchers, we extensively reviewed experimental literature, to
quantitatively characterize the binding of Ca2+ to TnC, the kinetics of
tropomyosin, the availability of binding sites, and the kinetics of
crossbridge binding after perturbations in sarcomere length. Model parameters
were determined from multiple experimental results and modalities (skinned and
intact preparations) and model results were validated against data from length
step, caged Ca2+, isometric twitches, and the half-time to relaxation with
increasing sarcomere length experiments. A factorial analysis found that the
[Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding of Ca2+ from TnC were the primary
determinants of relaxation, with a fivefold greater effect than that of
length-dependent maximum tension and twice the effect of tension-dependent
binding of Ca2+ to TnC and length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity. The affects of
the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding rate of Ca2+ from TnC were tightly
coupled with the effect of increasing either factor, depending on the
reference [Ca2+]i transient and unbinding rate.
